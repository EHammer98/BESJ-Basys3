Section (1) - PROJECT INFORMATION
---------------------------------
Name      = GameBesje
Directory = C:/Users/Elwin/Documents/GitHub/BESJ-Basys3/GameBesje

WARNING: Please verify the compiled library directory path for the following property in the
         current project. The path may point to an invalid location after opening this project.
